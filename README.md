# partial-json-parser
Parse complete javascript objects from partial JSON strings. I looked around a bit for something that could parse chunked data from a fetch request, but could not find an implementation that was either minimal or written in javascript. Tested this against some random nested data generated by www.json-generator.com, but there could still be issues if any string values contain escape characters.

# Description
Incomplete JSON strings will be parsed to its nearest complete object. 

Input: 
`{
  name: {
    first: 'ind',
    last: 'go`
    
Output:
{
  name: {
    first: 'ind'
  }
}

# Installation
From the CLI:

    `npm install --save partial-json-parser`
    
From javascript:

    `var partialParse = require('partial-json-parser');`\n
    `var output = partialParse('"key": "value"');`
    
Alternatively, you can directly use the script in the browser with a script tag.
